# Videos/Images Dark Mode
A Chrome extension that inverts the colors of videos or images to achieve a dark mode effect. It is most suitable for learning materials that contain black text on white backgrounds that cannot be converted by other extensions. I developed this extension when watching a Udemy course and badly needed the video to be dark to reduce eye strain.
# Usage
Add the extension from the Chrome Web Store from this link: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/videosimages-dark-mode/egkgdoiioagffceffhecmfcheomnglno?hl=en
Select the Enable checkbox
Select the Videos Dark Mode and/or Images Dark mode checkboxes
Refresh the page if nothing changed.
Voila!
