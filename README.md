# Videos/Images Dark Mode
A Chrome extension that inverts the colors of videos or images to achieve a dark mode effect. It is most suitable for learning materials that contain black text on white backgrounds that cannot be converted by other extensions. I developed this extension when watching a Udemy course and badly needed the video to be dark to reduce eye strain.
# Usage
1. Add the extension from the Chrome Web Store from this link: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/videosimages-dark-mode/egkgdoiioagffceffhecmfcheomnglno?hl=en.  
2. Select the Enable checkbox.  
3. Select the Videos Dark Mode and/or Images Dark mode checkboxes.  
4. Refresh the page if nothing changed.  
5. Voila!
# What I learnt
- How to develop browser extensions.
- MutationObserver API in JavaScript.
- CSS property to apply filters to media.
